Description: General purpose computer algebra system: main binary and modules
 Fricas is useful for
 research and development of mathematical algorithms. It defines a
 strongly typed, mathematically correct type hierarchy. It has a
 programming language and a built-in compiler.
 .
 Fricas has been in development since 1973 and was sold as a
 commercial product. It has been released as free software.
 .
 Efforts are underway to extend this software to (a) develop a
 better user interface (b) make it useful as a teaching tool
 (c) develop an algebra server protocol (d) integrate additional
 mathematics (e) rebuild the algebra in a literate programming style
 (f) integrate logic programming (g) develop an Fricas Journal with
 refereed submissions.
 .
 This package contains a work in progress version of FriCAS that
 integrates a minimal interface to Julia.
